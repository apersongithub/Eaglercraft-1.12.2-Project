Eaglercraft uses the decompiled source of the official version of Minecraft 1.12 from Mojang decompiled by MCP http://www.modcoderpack.com/ and compiled to Javascript using TeaVM https://teavm.org/. Therefore it can join any Minecraft 1.12 server, as it is really running (a modified version of) Minecraft 1.12 in the browser. However, due to CORS restrictions it must use a modified version of Bungeecord which proxies the browser's Websocket connection to the pure TCP connection used by Minecraft. For graphics, a custom compatibility layer created by me allows the fixed function OpenGL 1.3 based rendering engine mojang uses to operate through an HTML5 WebGL canvas with minimal changes to the source.
